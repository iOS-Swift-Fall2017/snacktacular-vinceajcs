Hi! To whoever grades my homework, please know that I tried to commit and push the Pods folder but it wouldn't let me for some reason. 
It gave me a warning that said "The working copy 'Pods' failed to commit files. Warning: empty strings as pathspecs will be made invalid 
in upcoming releases. please use . instead if you meat to match all paths". 

I spent an hour+ trying to add it via terminal, but when I did, it just added it as a submodule instead of a folder.
